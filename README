1. Objective and Motivation
I wanted to build a compact portable electronic device that measures electrical components, specifically resistance, capacitance, and ambient light intensity ( illuminance ),
offering a user-friendly interface, easy to use, and leaving space for future extensions. 

I had a box full of electronic components and no convenient tool to identify or measure them quickly. Rather than buying a commercial instrument, I decided to design and build a custom handheld meter to meet my needs.
