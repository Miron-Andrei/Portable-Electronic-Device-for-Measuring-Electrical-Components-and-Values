The full diploma thesis is attached in PDF format (Romanian language).
Even though the document is in Romanian, it contains detailed explanations, schematics, and references that support the project. 
For international readers, the README provides a short English summary of the objectives, components, results, and challenges.
Also i added the main code used in my project. I am open to any feedback !!!

1. Objective and Motivation
I set out to build a compact, portable electronic device that measures common electrical components—specifically resistance, capacitance, and ambient light intensity (illuminance). 
The goal was a user‑friendly handheld meter with a simple interface and room for future extensions.

I had a box full of electronic parts and no convenient tool to identify or measure them quickly. Rather than buying a commercial instrument, I designed and built a custom meter tailored to my needs.

2. Project Overview and Components used
The device is a multifunction handheld meter based on an Arduino Nano. It reads sensor signals, performs measurements using simple conditioning circuits, displays results on a compact screen, and is controlled via physical pushbuttons.
All electronics are mounted inside a standard electrical junction box with cutouts for the display, buttons, and ports.

Main components used:
Microcontroller: Arduino Nano
Light sensor: BH1750 for ambient light intensity measurements
Display: TFT ST7735 
User input: Physical pushbuttons for menu navigation and function selection
Resistance measurement circuit: Reference resistors ( 1 kOhm ) and unknown resistances
Capacitance measurement circuit: Timing-based on charge/discharge circuits to estimate capacitance
Power system: Li‑Po 18650 battery (3.7 V) with charging/management module TP4056
Auxiliary parts: Wiring, connectors, PCB 
Junction Box

The electrical schematics and photos (including a short demo of the device in use) are included in the attached materials.

3. Accuracy and Usability Features
Typical measurement error ranges from 1% to 5%, depending on the measurement range and connection quality.
For example, a 3.3 kΩ resistor measured about 3.23 kΩ, and a 100 Ω resistor measured 99.89 Ω. A 10 kΩ resistor was reported as 8.94 kΩ, which is under the reliable range for the current setup; for out‑of‑range or unreliable readings the device displays "Unknown resistor".
Accuracy is best when the measured value is near the reference resistor (1 kΩ).
Each measured resistor is also shown with a color code on the display to speed up identification and sorting. 

For capacitance I tested values from 100 pF up to 470 µF (16 V) with similar 1–5% errors.
These errors are acceptable in practice because component tolerances listed on datasheets commonly range from 1% to 10% depending on the part and conditions.

For illuminance I had no reference meter for comparison, but the BH1750 sensor responds and appears to function correctly.

4. Challenges and Lessons Learned
The biggest challenge was the software interface: implementing all functions, updating values in real time, and reliably returning to the main menu. 
Early versions frequently became stuck in void loop; restructuring the code into a clear state machine and adding proper button debouncing fixed most issues.
Hardware problems included unstable readings from breadboard wiring and poor contacts; moving to soldered connections greatly improved stability.
Power management was another lesson the TP4056 module expects a proper input and the battery configuration must match the module limits.

I also learned how challenging soldering and mechanical assembly can be without specialized tools, and how important careful layout and secure mounting are for a compact handheld device.

I attached the Arduino Forums where I discussed my problems.
